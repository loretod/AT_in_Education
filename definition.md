# Definition

Let's begin with the tried and true definition of assistive technology:

Assistive technology refers to any device, software, or equipment that helps people with disabilities or impairments to perform tasks that might otherwise be difficult or impossible for them. It includes a wide range of tools such as hearing aids, screen readers, speech recognition software, and mobility aids.

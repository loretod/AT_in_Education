# Definitions

Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) legislation, assistive technology (AT) is defined as any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability. AT can include a wide range of devices, software, and equipment, such as communication devices, hearing aids, mobility devices, adaptive switches, and computer software. The purpose of AT is to help children with disabilities access their education and participate in their daily activities to the fullest extent possible. IDEA requires that schools consider the use of AT for any child with a disability who needs it to benefit from their education.

Assistive Technology (AT) services are defined as any service that directly assists a child with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device. AT services can include evaluations, assessments, training, and technical assistance to ensure that the device is being used effectively. AT services may also include the coordination and implementation of assistive technology devices and services, as well as ongoing support and maintenance. The goal of AT services is to help children with disabilities access their education and participate in their daily activities to the fullest extent possible. IDEA requires that schools provide AT services to any child with a disability who needs them to benefit from their education.

Some key points to highlight in these definitions include the distinction that AT can be custom and fabricated and includes product systems not only tangible items. AT services are also a crucial component for effective AT implementation and should not be overlooked. Successful implementation relies on a well-trained and collaborative educational team.

AT is often broken down into 3 main categories:

```

- **Low Tech** - are devices or systems that do not include electrical components or circuits. They are easy to utilize and require very little training or support prior to usage. Some examples include: adapted writing paper, paper grips, and picture schedules.

- **Mid- Tech** - are devices that have a limited scope of use and contain circuitry. They are often battery powered. These devices require some training for proper usage. Some examples include: reading pens and talking dictionaries.

- **High- Tech** - are devices that contain complex circuitry and may serve multiple purposes. They often require extensive training for effective usage. Some examples include: tablet based communication apps, eye gaze access, or literacy supporting software.

## Categories of Disabilities

Disabilities may be broken up in three major categories. Each impacting students in their role of learning differently. Disabilities may be temporary due to an acute injury or chronic and long-standing.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), in the 2019-2020 school year, approximately 7.0 million students ages 3-21 (14%) received special education services in the United States under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Of these students, the most common disability categories were:

1. Specific learning disability (35%)

2. Speech or language impairment (20%)

3. Autism (11%)

4. Intellectual disability (7%)

5. Emotional disturbance (7%)

6. Other health impairment (6%)

7. Multiple disabilities (3%)

8. Hearing impairment (2%)

9. Orthopedic impairment (2%)

10. Visual impairment (1%)

It is important to note that these statistics only include students who receive special education services under IDEA and may not capture the full extent of disability prevalence among school-age children in the US.

### Sensory Disabilities

Sensory-based disabilities refer to disabilities that affect one or more of the senses, including sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. These disabilities can impact an individual's ability to perceive and process sensory information, which can affect their daily functioning and quality of life. Examples of sensory-based disabilities include:

1. Visual impairments, such as blindness or low vision, which can affect a person's ability to see and process visual information.

2. Hearing impairments, such as deafness or hard of hearing, which can affect a person's ability to hear and process auditory information.

3. Sensory processing disorders, which can affect a person's ability to process and respond to sensory information, leading to difficulties with sensory integration, motor coordination, and social interaction.

4. Taste and smell impairments, which can affect a person's ability to taste and smell, leading to difficulties with food selection, nutrition, and safety.

### Motor Disabilities

Motor disabilities refer to disabilities that affect a person's ability to control their movements and perform physical tasks. These disabilities can be caused by a variety of factors, including neurological conditions, genetic disorders, and injuries. Examples of motor disabilities include:

1. Cerebral palsy, which is a neurological disorder that affects movement, coordination, and muscle tone.

2. Muscular dystrophy, which is a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and atrophy.

3. Spinal cord injuries, which can result in paralysis or loss of sensation below the site of the injury.

Individuals with motor disabilities may require accommodations and assistive technology to support their mobility and facilitate their participation in daily activities. This can include mobility aids such as wheelchairs, walkers, and canes, as well as adaptive equipment for activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and grooming.

### Cognitive Disabilities

Cognitive disabilities in children refer to a range of conditions that affect a child's ability to learn, think, reason, and process information. These disabilities can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic disorders, brain injuries, and neurological conditions. Examples of cognitive disabilities in children include:

1. Intellectual disabilities, which are characterized by significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior.

2. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a child's ability to focus, control impulses, and regulate behavior.

3. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects a child's social communication and interaction skills, as well as their behavior and interests.

4. Learning disabilities, which can affect a child's ability to read, write, and perform mathematical calculations.

### Communication Disabilities

Communication disabilities in children refer to a range of conditions that affect a child's ability to communicate effectively with others. These disabilities can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic disorders, neurological conditions, and developmental delays. Examples of communication disabilities in children include:

1. Speech disorders, which can affect a child's ability to produce speech sounds, fluently communicate their thoughts, or use language effectively.

2. Language disorders, which can affect a child's ability to understand and use language, including difficulties with grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension.

3. Hearing impairments, which can affect a child's ability to hear and process auditory information, leading to difficulties with speech and language development.

4. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which can affect a child's ability to communicate and interact with others, including difficulties with social communication and nonverbal communication.

# Technology Frameworks Overview

Technology has greatly increased its presence within education. There are three main applications of technology in this setting. These include:

### Universal Design for Learning

Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a research based framework for designing instruction that provides all students with equal opportunities to learn and succeed. UDL is based on the principles of universal design, which is an approach to design that aims to create products and environments that are accessible and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

UDL is designed to address the variability of learners by providing multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement. This means that instruction is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing students to access and engage with the content in ways that work best for them.

The three principles of UDL are:

Providing students with multiple ways to engage with the content and stay motivated and interested. Subsets include providing options for:

```{dropdown} Recruiting Interest
- Optimize individual choice and autonomy 
- Optimize relevance, value, and authenticity
- Minimize threats and distractions
```

```{dropdown} Sustaining Effort & Persistence
- Heighten salience of goals and objectives
- Vary demands and resources to optimize challenge
- Foster collaboration and community 
- Increase mastery-oriented feedback
```

```{dropdown} Self Regulation
- Promote expectations and beliefs that optimize motivation
- Facilitate personal coping skills and strategies
- Develop self-assessment and reflection
```

Providing information in multiple formats and modalities to address the variability of learners. Subsets include providing options for:

```{dropdown} Perception
- Offer ways of customizing the display of information
- Offer alternatives for auditory information
- Offer alternatives for visual information
```

```{dropdown} Language and Symbols
- Clarify vocabulary and symbols
- Clarify syntax and structure
- Support decoding of text, mathematical notation, and symbols
- Promote understanding across languages
- Illustrate through multiple media
```

```{dropdown} Comprehension
- Activate or supply background knowledge
- Highlight patterns, critical features, big ideas, and relationships
- Guide information processing and visualization
- Maximize transfer and generalization
```

Providing students with multiple ways to demonstrate their learning and understanding. Subsets include providing options for:

```{dropdown} Physical Options
- Vary the methods for response and navigation
- Optimize access to tools and assistive technologies
```

```{dropdown} Expression and Communication
- Use multiple media for communication
- Use multiple tools for construction and composition
- Build fluencies with graduated levels of support for practice and performance
```

```{dropdown} Executive Functions
- Guide appropriate goal-setting
- Support planning and strategy development
- Facilitate managing information and resources
- Enhance capacity for monitoring progress
```

UDL is designed to be used in all aspects of instruction, including curriculum design, instructional strategies, assessment, and technology. By using UDL, educators can create learning environments that are inclusive, engaging, and effective for all students.

CAST is the organization that developed this framework and continues to conduct research, education, and advocacy UDL. They develop and maintain an interactive graphic organizer diving deeper into each key principle.

### SETT Framework

The SETT framework is a model for assistive technology (AT) decision-making that considers a range of factors in determining appropriate AT solutions for individuals with disabilities. SETT stands for Student, Environment, Tasks, and Tools.

- Student: This refers to the individual with the disability who requires AT. In this step, the evaluator or team would gather information on the student's strengths, challenges, preferences, and needs.

- Environment: This refers to the physical, social, and cultural context in which the student will use the AT. This includes factors such as the physical layout of the environment, the social dynamics and expectations, and cultural norms.

- Tasks: This refers to the specific activities that the student needs to be able to do using the AT. This step involves breaking down the tasks into smaller components and identifying where AT can be of assistance.
- Tools: This refers to the range of AT solutions available to support the student's tasks. This step involves considering both low-tech and high-tech AT solutions, and evaluating how well each option meets the student's needs, preferences, and goals.

By systematically considering each of these four factors, the SETT model can help teams make informed decisions about appropriate AT solutions for individuals with disabilities.

### Toolkit Model
The Toolkit model for assistive technology (AT) is a framework that helps guide the AT decision-making process. The model includes six stages:

- Referral: In this stage, the need for AT is identified and a referral is made to the appropriate personnel, such as an AT specialist.
- Screening: This stage involves a preliminary assessment of the individual's needs and abilities to determine if AT is appropriate and, if so, what type of AT might be helpful.
- Assessment: In this stage, a comprehensive assessment is conducted to gather information about the individual's needs, abilities, and environment, as well as potential AT solutions.
- Planning: Based on the assessment, a plan is developed that outlines the AT solutions that will be recommended, including the specific devices or tools that will be used.
- Implementation: This stage involves the selection, acquisition, and integration of the AT solutions into the individual's daily life. It may also include training for the individual and their support network on how to use the AT effectively.
- Follow-up: Finally, follow-up is conducted to ensure that the AT solutions are meeting the individual's needs and to address any issues or concerns that may arise.

The Toolkit model emphasizes a collaborative, person-centered approach to AT decision-making, where the individual with a disability and their support network are actively involved throughout the process. It also recognizes that the AT decision-making process is iterative and may require ongoing evaluation and adjustment to ensure that the AT solutions continue to meet the individual's changing needs over time.

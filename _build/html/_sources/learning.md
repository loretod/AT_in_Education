```{tab-item} Pencil Grips
Pencil grips are small devices that can be placed onto the end of a pencil or pen to help individuals maintain a comfortable and efficient grip while writing. Here are some benefits of using pencil grips:

1. Improved handwriting: Pencil grips can help individuals write more neatly and legibly. By providing a comfortable and stable grip, pencil grips can help prevent shaky lines, smudging, and other common handwriting issues.

2. Reduced hand fatigue: Pencil grips can help reduce hand fatigue and cramping, especially for individuals who write for extended periods of time. By providing a cushioned and ergonomic grip, pencil grips can help reduce strain on the muscles and tendons in the hand and wrist.
Better grip control: Pencil grips can help individuals maintain better control over their writing utensils. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals who have difficulty gripping or manipulating objects due to physical limitations or disabilities.

3. Increased confidence: By improving handwriting and reducing hand fatigue, pencil grips can help boost an individual's confidence in their writing abilities. This can be especially important for children who are learning to write, as it can help them feel more successful and motivated to continue practicing.

```{tab-item} Adapted Paper
Adapted writing paper is designed to help individuals who have difficulty with handwriting or have specific needs related to writing. Here are some benefits of using adapted writing paper:

1. Improved letter formation: Adapted writing paper can include features such as raised lines, dotted lines, or color-coded lines that help individuals form letters more accurately and consistently.

2. Enhanced spacing and alignment: Some types of adapted writing paper may include additional spacing between lines or boxes for each letter, making it easier for individuals to align their writing and maintain consistent spacing.

3. Increased legibility: Adapted writing paper can help individuals with visual impairments or other difficulties in reading small print by using larger font sizes or increased contrast between the paper and ink.

4. Reduced frustration: For individuals who struggle with handwriting, using adapted writing paper can help reduce frustration and increase confidence in their writing abilities.

5. Personalized options: Adapted writing paper can be customized to meet the specific needs of individuals with various physical or cognitive disabilities. For example, some types of adapted paper may have larger margins, wider lines, or unique layouts.

#### Word Processing

#### Word Prediction

Word prediction is a feature that is commonly found in text input systems, such as computer or mobile phone keyboards. It is designed to help users save time and effort when typing by predicting the word they are trying to type based on the characters they have already entered.

Word prediction algorithms typically use machine learning techniques to analyze the context of the text being typed and suggest a list of words that are most likely to be the next word. This list of words is then presented to the user, who can choose the desired word by selecting it from the list. Word prediction may be confused with auto complete which recommends phrase or sentence completion.

Word prediction can be especially helpful for people with disabilities or mobility issues who may have difficulty typing quickly or accurately. This support is also beneficial for students who struggle with phonemic spelling patterns, who spell check is unable to correct. There are specialized word prediction tools that use custom machine learning models taking these variations into consideration.

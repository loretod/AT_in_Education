# Open Assistive Technology

Open assistive technology refers to any technology or device that is designed and developed using open source principles. Open source technology is characterized by its accessibility, transparency, and collaborative nature. This means that the technology can be freely accessed, modified, and distributed by anyone, and that the development process is open to community involvement and feedback. Open assistive technology can include devices such as prosthetics, hearing aids, communication aids, and mobility aids, among others. By using open source principles, open assistive technology can help to reduce costs, increase innovation, and improve accessibility for people with disabilities.

In recent years, the cost of fabrication equipment and materials such as 3D printers, microcontrollers, and components has greatly decreased democratizing access. In addition, a variety of programming languages for microcontrollers has lowered the entry barrier, allowing more novice makers to fabricate custom solutions.

OpenAT rests on three primary pillars:
